# Economic Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project utilizes Python, Pandas, Plotly, and the FRED API to analyze economic data. It covers various aspects, including retrieving S&P 500 data, unemployment rates by state, and labor force participation rates. The project offers insights into economic trends through data retrieval, cleaning, and visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Required Python packages (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - plotly
  - fredapi
  - time

## Important note : Plotly output cant be seen in Github but it can seen when the code runs in any jupiter platform.

### Usage

1. Set up your FRED API key.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook or script to execute the data analysis and visualization.

## Project Structure

- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for economic data analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required for the project.

## Acknowledgments
